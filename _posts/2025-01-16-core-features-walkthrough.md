# Core Features Walkthrough: The Complete RightNow Experience

Let's take a deep dive into what makes RightNow different. This isn't just another feature list - it's a guided tour through the philosophy and functionality that makes capacity-first planning work.

## 🎯 The Capacity System: Your North Star

The capacity bar isn't just visual decoration - it's the core constraint that makes everything else work.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Set Daily Hours] --> B[Track Usage]
    B --> C[Visual Feedback]
    C --> D[Prevent Overcommit]
    D --> E[Sustainable Planning]
```

### How It Works

1. **Set Your Reality**: Start with your actual available hours (not wishful thinking)
2. **Real-Time Tracking**: See capacity fill up as you add tasks
3. **Visual Warnings**: Red zones when you're approaching limits
4. **Smart Suggestions**: "You have 2 hours left - perfect for these tasks"

### The Psychology Behind It

Traditional apps let you add infinite tasks. RightNow says "Hold on - you only have 6 hours today. Choose wisely." This constraint forces better decision-making.

**Example Day:**
- 8 hours at work
- 2 hours for meetings/breaks
- **6 hours capacity** for focused work
- Tasks must fit within this reality

## ⏱️ Time Tracking That Actually Helps

Most time tracking feels like surveillance. Ours feels like learning.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Task] --> B[Built-in Timer]
    B --> C[Track Real Time]
    C --> D[Compare to Estimate]
    D --> E[Learn & Improve]
    E --> F[Better Future Estimates]
```

### Key Features

- **One-Tap Start**: No complex setup, just hit play
- **Automatic Learning**: App improves estimates based on your patterns
- **Flexible Tracking**: Pause, resume, or adjust as needed
- **Privacy First**: All data stays on your device

### What Users Discover

*"I thought emails took 5 minutes. They actually take 20 minutes on average."*

*"My most productive hours are 10am-12pm, not after lunch like I thought."*

*"Writing takes 3x longer than I estimate, but coding is pretty accurate."*

## 🎮 Task Grooming Games: Making Planning Fun

The most unique feature in RightNow - gamified task management that people actually enjoy.

### The Priority Game

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Task Card] --> B[Swipe Up = High Priority]
    A --> C[Swipe Down = Low Priority]
    A --> D[Swipe Left = Maybe Later]
    B --> E[Score Points]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

**How It Works:**
- Swipe up for high priority tasks
- Swipe down for low priority  
- Swipe left for "maybe later"
- Build streaks for consistent grooming

### The Duration Game

Quick time estimation made fun:

- **Swipe Right**: "This will take longer than expected"
- **Swipe Left**: "This is quicker than it looks"
- **Swipe Up**: "Perfect estimate as-is"

### The Clarity Game

Improve task descriptions through interaction:

- Rate task clarity (1-5 stars)
- Add missing details
- Break down vague tasks
- Score points for improvements

### Why Games Work

1. **Removes Friction**: Fun beats tedious
2. **Builds Habits**: Streaks encourage consistency
3. **Reduces Overwhelm**: One task at a time
4. **Provides Closure**: Clear completion signals

## 📊 Analytics That Drive Action

Data without insight is just noise. RightNow's analytics tell you what to do next.

### The Dashboard

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Data] --> B[Completion Patterns]
    A --> C[Time Estimation Accuracy]
    A --> D[Productivity Trends]
    A --> E[Capacity Utilization]
    
    B --> F[Actionable Insights]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

### Key Metrics

**Completion Rate**: How often you finish what you plan
- Target: 80% (not 100% - that's perfectionism)
- Insight: "Your Tuesday completion rate is 65% - consider lighter scheduling"

**Estimation Accuracy**: How close your estimates are to reality
- Target: Within 20% of actual time
- Insight: "You underestimate writing tasks by 40% on average"

**Capacity Utilization**: How much of your available time you actually use
- Target: 70-80% (buffer for unexpected tasks)
- Insight: "You're using 95% capacity - consider reducing by 1 hour"

**Peak Performance Times**: When you're most productive
- Insight: "You complete 60% more tasks between 9-11am"

### Personalized Recommendations

- "Schedule important tasks for Tuesday mornings"
- "Add 15 minutes to your writing estimates"
- "Consider reducing capacity from 7 to 6 hours"
- "You haven't groomed tasks in 3 days - quick session?"

## 🔍 Smart Search & Filtering

Find what you need without thinking about it.

### Search That Understands Context

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Search Query] --> B[Text Matching]
    A --> C[Tag Matching]
    A --> D[Priority Weighting]
    A --> E[Recency Boosting]
    
    B --> F[Relevant Results]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

**Examples:**
- "email" → finds tasks with "email" in title or description
- "#urgent" → finds all urgent-tagged tasks
- "project meeting" → finds tasks with both words, prioritizes recent ones

### Advanced Filters

**By Status:**
- Scheduled for today
- Unscheduled backlog
- Completed tasks
- In progress

**By Time:**
- Duration range (e.g., 30-60 minutes)
- Created this week
- Due soon
- Overdue

**By Context:**
- Specific tags
- Priority levels
- Estimated energy needed
- Location context

### Saved Filter Combinations

Create custom views for different contexts:

- "Morning Deep Work" → High priority, 60+ minutes, #focus tag
- "Quick Wins" → Low priority, <30 minutes, any tag
- "Client Work" → #client tag, sorted by deadline
- "Personal Projects" → #personal tag, sorted by interest

## 🏷️ Tagging System That Scales

Simple enough for beginners, powerful enough for power users.

- `#client-work`, `#internal`

### Tag Intelligence

The app learns from your tagging patterns:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Tag Usage] --> B[Pattern Recognition]
    B --> C[Auto-Suggestions]
    B --> D[Workflow Optimization]
    B --> E[Context Switching Insights]
```

**Smart Suggestions:**
- "Tasks tagged #writing usually take 45 minutes"
- "You're most productive with #creative tasks at 10am"
- "Consider batching #administrative tasks on Fridays"

graph LR
