# Who RightNow is For: Target Audience & Real-World Use Cases

After months of user research, beta testing, and real-world feedback, I've discovered that RightNow resonates with a specific type of person. This isn't for everyone - and that's by design.

## The Core Problem We Solve

RightNow addresses **chronic overcommitment** - the tendency to plan more than we can actually accomplish. This affects different groups in unique ways.

## Primary Target Audience

### 🎯 The "Overwhelmed Achiever"

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-45 years old
- Income: $50k-$120k annually
- Education: College-educated professionals
- Location: Urban/suburban, knowledge work environments

**Characteristics:**
- High standards for themselves
- Juggles multiple projects simultaneously
- Feels guilty about unfinished tasks
- Constantly underestimates time requirements
- Values systems and structure
