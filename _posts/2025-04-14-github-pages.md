I used the Claude AI to brainstorm ideas for this blog. I didn't know when I started that conversation if I would end up executing on anything but here we are. Park of the draw for actually starting the blog was the idea of using github pages and writing in markdown (I am such a nerd).

So to get started with this blog I had Claude generate the folder structure and walk me through setting up pages on github. It then helped me with a github action that will push out a new page whenever I push to master. My work has always been very Microsoft based, so I know that github can do what Azure DevOps can do but I had never had any reason to check it out. The blog itself is a great learning experience for me here!

Just to get this out of the way: I think that when you use AI you have to use it as a tool and not a crutch.

I then used Jekyll which is a "free and open-source static site generator written in Ruby". Web design is not my forte or interest so I'm happy to use a tool that can take markdown and make it presentable. So this is what the repo looks like and each time I commit to _posts and push, I get a post published to the site. Wonderful.
