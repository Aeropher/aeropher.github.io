I'm excited to share about a creative group I'm involved with called **Caffeine Addled Minds** - a media collective founded by two brothers that has grown into a diverse content network featuring multiple podcasts and YouTube channels.

## What is Caffeine Addled Minds?

Caffeine Addled Minds is a creative media group that produces entertaining content across various platforms. What started as a single podcast has evolved into a collection of shows, each with its own unique flavor and audience.

## Our Podcasts

### 🥃 Caskheads

<img src="/images/camlogos/logo_caskheads.png" alt="Caskheads Logo" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; max-width: 150px;">

Our flagship podcast where we dive into the world of whisky production with a light-hearted approach. Perfect for both whisky enthusiasts and newcomers who want to learn about this fascinating spirit without the pretentiousness often associated with it.

### 📻 GNSRadio

A unique dystopian storytelling experience told entirely through radio host announcements. This innovative format creates an immersive narrative that unfolds through seemingly routine broadcasts in a world that's anything but ordinary.

### 🎙️ "Dude, you good?"

<img src="/images/camlogos/logo_dude_you_good.png" alt="Dude You Good Logo" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; max-width: 150px;">

A millennial conversation podcast where two friends discuss their interests, experiences, and the quirks of modern life. It's the kind of conversation you'd have with your best friend over coffee - genuine, funny, and relatable.

For those wanting even more candid content, we also produce **"Dude you good? After Dark!"** - a more unfiltered version where we really let loose.

## YouTube Presence

Beyond podcasts, we've expanded into video content:

### 🎮 CaffeineAddledGames

Our main gaming channel featuring a variety of gaming content, from let's plays to reviews. This is where Jordan posts episodes of **Bedrock Bites**, our collaborative Minecraft let's play series where we adventure through Minecraft Bedrock Edition on Xbox. The channel showcases our love for gaming with the same energy and humor that defines all our Caffeine Addled content. Because what goes better with caffeine than video games?

### 🎮 AeropherXD

My personal YouTube channel where I post gaming content, including **Bedrock Bites** episodes. Bedrock Bites is a let's play series where Jordan and I (Alex) team up to play Minecraft Bedrock Edition together on Xbox consoles. Watch us explore, build, and occasionally get into hilarious mishaps as we navigate the blocky world together! The channel features various gaming content beyond just Minecraft, bringing my own style and perspective to the games I love.
