# Beginning My 3D Printing Journey

We were in the midst of a pandemic and on an absolute whim I bought a creality ender 3 for about £130. I still have this printer although it is unplugged and I really should sell it or use the parts in some other project. I've been a little obsessed ever since but I am sorely lacking in the 3D modelling skills department so most of my printing has been using other peoples designs and files which has been enormously helpful. 

It's a fantastic open source, collaborative world of creativity and the manufacturing possibilities are endless.

## Getting Started

So I bought the ender 3 which came disassembled and I spent the day putting it together. There were 2 things that I struggled with when it came to getting it working on day 1. the first was to do with the eccentric screws in the build plate being too tight. I thought it was a manufacturing defect at first for the spacers to be off center. But once I got the pressure relieved the bed moved forwards and backwards nicely. The second issue was that it was too dang cold in the house and the benchies I was printing would come off the bed half way through. I learned that I could not keep the printer in my garage. 

From there the lessons kept coming. I print today with a Bambu P1S and I tell you the experience is night and day.

## First Projects

My first successful prints were simple calibration cubes, benchies and small figurines, but seeing them print successfully gave me the same satisfaction I get when writing good code. I did what everyone does and printed a tonne of mods for the printer itself.

## Automation

I then went on to get a raspberry pi and started to make some time lapses. 

## What's Next

Life gets in the way of hobbies sometimes and the truly advanced projects have not taken off yet so what better way to make sure I do the things I want than to put it on the internet and be held accountable by the people.

Stay tuned for more 3D printing adventures!
