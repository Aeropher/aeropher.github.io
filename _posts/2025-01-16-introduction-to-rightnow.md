# Introduction to RightNow: A Capacity-First Productivity App

Welcome to RightNow, a revolutionary approach to task management that puts your daily capacity first. Unlike traditional to-do apps that let you pile on endless tasks, RightNow helps you plan realistic, achievable days by enforcing time-based constraints.

## The Problem with Traditional Task Management

We've all been there - starting the day with an ambitious to-do list, only to end it feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. Traditional task managers encourage us to add everything we can think of, creating lists that are impossible to complete in a single day. This leads to:

- **Chronic overwhelm** from unrealistic daily goals
- **Decision fatigue** from too many choices
- **Guilt and stress** from unfinished tasks
- **Poor time estimation** without feedback loops

## The RightNow Solution

RightNow takes a fundamentally different approach: **capacity-first planning**. Instead of asking "What do I need to do?", we ask "How much time do I actually have today?"

### Core Philosophy

1. **Time is finite** - Every day has a limited number of productive hours
2. **Realistic planning** - Only schedule what you can actually accomplish
3. **Immediate feedback** - Know instantly if you're overcommitting
4. **Focus on today** - Prioritize what matters right now

## Key Features That Make the Difference

### 🎯 Capacity Management
- Set your daily available hours (e.g., 6 productive hours)
- Visual progress bar shows capacity usage in real-time
- Instant warnings when you exceed your limit
- Override options for flexibility when needed

### ⏱️ Built-in Time Tracking
- Start/stop timer for any task
- Tracks actual vs. estimated time
- Learns from your patterns to improve estimates
- Helps you understand where time really goes

### 🎮 Gamified Task Grooming
- Fun, swipe-based games to refine your backlog
- Improve task clarity, estimates, and priorities
- Build better planning habits through engagement

### 🔄 Offline-First Architecture

## Why RightNow Works

RightNow succeeds where other apps fail because it:

1. **Enforces realistic constraints** - You can't schedule 12 hours of work in an 8-hour day
2. **Provides immediate feedback** - See capacity impact before committing
3. **Learns from your behavior** - Improves estimates based on actual completion times
4. **Focuses on execution** - Today's tasks are front and center
5. **Respects your time** - No feature bloat or complicated workflows

## Perfect For

- **Knowledge workers** juggling multiple projects
- **Students** managing coursework and deadlines
- **Freelancers** tracking billable hours
