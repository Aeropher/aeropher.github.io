# Productivity Systems

I truly did not care about proces and productivity systems until I got into the working world. I believed that you don't need to think about *how* to do something, you just needed to get on and do it. If you still feel that way, I am not here to tell you that you are wrong. You do you.

So once in the working world, I was forced to use taskboards and SCRUM to manage my time. I found it very effective and I have tried numerous times to add some sort of similar system into my non-working life but with no real success. But I think that the reason for this is that I didnt really have anything going on in my non-work life. Nothing that needed tracking and actioning really. But now I do. You get more responsibilities as you get older. House, Life, Friends, Family. If you find that you don't need to track anything then don't feel bad for not tracking it.

There is no one system for anyone. I actually believe that all these "Systems" Should really be thought of as techniques. You can use any technique you want to get the job done. I do think that there are some fundamental principles though that can guide you through the techniques that you use.

I'll be talking more on my every changing systems, tools and techniques as time goes on.
