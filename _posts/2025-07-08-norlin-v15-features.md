This post demonstrates the new features available in Norlin theme v1.5.

## New Callout Styles

The theme now supports beautiful callout blocks:

{: .note }
This is a note callout - useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

{: .tip }
This is a tip callout - helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

{: .important }
This is an important callout - key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

{: .warning }
This is a warning callout - urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

{: .caution }
This is a caution callout - advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

## Full-Width Images

You can now display images in full-width mode by adding `#wide` to the image URL:

Regular images still display normally:

## Improved Typography

The theme continues to support all standard markdown features with improved styling for better readability.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### Blockquotes
