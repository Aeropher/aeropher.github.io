# My App Development Journey

Welcome to my apps page! Here you'll find information about the mobile and web applications I'm developing.

## üì± Current Projects

### RightNow (In Development)

A better todo app that I'm building to scratch my own itch. After years in backend DevOps, I decided to dive into Flutter and create the task management app I've always wanted.

**Status**: Internal testing on Google Play Store

**Tech Stack**:
- Flutter (cross-platform)
- Firebase backend
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Future Projects

More apps coming soon! I'm particularly interested in:
- Productivity tools
- Utility applications
- Creative tools for content creators

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Philosophy

As someone who's spent 10+ years in backend and infrastructure, diving into app development has been both challenging and rewarding. I believe in:

- **Building what you need**: Every app should solve a real problem
- **Learning by doing**: Using AI assistants wisely while understanding the code
- **Cross-platform first**: Why build twice when you can build once?
