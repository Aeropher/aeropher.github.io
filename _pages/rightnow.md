# RightNow App Development

## 🎉 Alpha Testing Update (July 2025)

RightNow is now in Alpha testing! I've given access to about 10 friends and family members, and the feedback has been both surprising and unsurprising. Many changes are being made each day as they discover things that need improvement.

None of them are professional testers, and their method of testing is basically to be confused - which is actually quite valuable! This isn't a simple app, but it needs to be intuitive to normal people, even if it doesn't appeal to them for long-term use.

I'm pretty proud of how far I've come with this project. It's my most successful home coding project so far, and I've been working on it since March/April 2024.

### Latest Change: Task Reflection UX Improvement

Based on Alpha feedback, I've removed the initial dialog that asked users whether they wanted to enable task reflection. Instead, there's now a checkbox at the bottom of the actual task reflection screen that allows users to disable it if they don't want to use it. New users shouldn't be asked to turn something on or off before they've even seen what it is!
